    <p>I'll tell you a little about me in this short paragragh.
        <br>My name is Tyler Hobbs, I am going to the full stack emmersive program at Digitalcrafts,
        <br> and I've been having a great time learning code and seeing everyone do well in the program.
        <br> So far we've learned about using GIT, and Python,<br>and now we are learning HTML and its coming to me faster then Python did!
